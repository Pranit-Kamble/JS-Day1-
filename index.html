    <h1>JS Interview(Day 1)</h1>

<h3>1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h3>
<pre>
1. Both are comparison operators and they return boolean values always. The difference
between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas “ === “ is
used to compare both value and datatype.
2. var x="2";
var y=2;
3. console.log(x==y); It returns true because it only check values not data types. It is able
to check the values because in == it will do type coercion to change the data type so that
the value can be compared.
4. console.log(x===y); It returns false because you can see that values are same but x is of
String type and y is of Number type. You can find the type of any value by using typeof
operator.
5. So in strict equal comparison operator both value and data types should be same like x=2
and y=2 otherwise it returns false.

</pre>

<h3>2. What are the differences between var, let and const?</h3>
<pre>
var is a global scoped means variables created using var keyword will be accessible globally. It
can be redeclared and reinitialized.
var a = 10;
let is a block scoped means variables created using let keyword will be accessible only in that
specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared but it can be reinitialized.
let a = 20;
const is also block scoped means variables created using const keyword will be accessible only
in that specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared and cannot be
reinitialized.
const a = 30;

</pre>

<h3>3.What is hoisting?</h3>
<pre>
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations,
not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting. Let and const keywords are
not hoisted so when you try to access them before initialization they start giving you Reference
error.
console.log(message); //output : undefined
var message = 'The variable Has been hoisted';
The above code looks like as below to the interpreter that is why it gives us undefined.
var message;
console.log(message);
message = 'The variable Has been hoisted';
</pre>

<h3>4.What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
<pre>
The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable
with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const
variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when
that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the
temporal dead zone.
Let's see this behavior with an example,
function somemethod() {
console.log(counter1); // undefined
console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
var counter1 = 1;
let counter2 = 2;
}
    
</pre>

<h3>5. What is execution context?</h3>
<pre>
Each and every browser is having a JavaScript Engine, example Google is having V8 engine,
Internet Explorer is having Chakra and Mozilla Firefox is having Spider Monkey.
JS engine uses a Call stack and also creates a special environment to handle the execution of
the JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.
The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in
its execution.
During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables
and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets
executed.
There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
● Global Execution Context (GEC)
● Function Execution Context (FEC)
The moment code gets executed GEC gets created and gets pushed to Call Stack. Inside the
global or functional execution context, there are two phases : Memory allocation (Creation
Phase) and Code execution (Execution Phase).
Inside Memory allocation, the variables declared using var keyword get memory allocated as
undefined in global scope and variables declared using let or const gets their memory allocated
as undefined in block scope.
That is the reason why we can access the variables before initialization declared using var, it
will give undefined.
But if we will try to access the variables using let const before their initialization then it will
give Reference Error because these variables will be in block scope and can not be accessed
until unless they are not initialized. This is also known as temporal dead zone.
Whereas, functions gets memory allocated as their actual value defined in code. Inside Code
Execution, variables will get their actual value assigned to them. And functions will create a
functional execution context.
The moment this FEC will be created, it will be pushed to Call stack and once the execution of
the function is over then this FEC will be removed from the call stack and the point of
execution will again be moved to GEC.
</pre>

<h3>6.What is an event loop and call stack</h3>
<pre>
    A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser)
to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently
being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. or we can say that it
stores global execution context and function execution context.
The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the
call stack. All the web apis functions like setTimeout, setInterval, fetch calls etc. will not be
directly executed inside the execution context, firstly they will be moved to callback queue and
then the moment call stack gets empty these functions will be pushed to call stack from
callback queue by event loop.
If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function
from the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen

</pre>

<h3>7.What is creation phase and execution phase?</h3>
<pre>
    Compiler runs through the entire code for 2 time before actually executing the code, and
generates a Global Execution context , inside this we have two phases creation phase and
execution phase.
Creation Phase
1. In the first run, It picks all function declarations and stores them in memory with
their reference.
2. In the second run, It picks all variables and assign undefined to them. In the event of
a conflict between variable and function declaration name then that variable is
ignored.
Execution Phase
1. Variables assigned with values given in code at the time of initialization.
2. Functions executed
</pre>

<h3>8.What are callbacks?</h3>
<pre>
    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is
invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to
use callback function

function callbackFunction(name) {
console.log('Hello ' + name);
}
function outerFunction(callback) {
let name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
callback(name);
}
outerFunction(callbackFunction);
</pre>

<h3>9.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods.</h3>
<pre>
    These all three methods are used to invoke a function where we are supposed to pass an object
as first argument and at the time of definition we don't have mention this object as a parameter
and we can access the values of object by using this keyword in function definition.
call(): The call() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest
of the arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments.
var emp1={
name:"John",
age:21
}
var emp2={
name:"Smith",
age:22
}
function invite(greeting1,greeting2){
console.log(greeting1+" "+this.name+" "+greeting2)
}
invite.call(emp1,"Hi","How are you!")
Output: Hi John How are you!
apply(): The apply() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and
rest of the arguments will be passed as an array of elements.
invite.apply(emp2,["hey dude," ,"how are you!"])
Output: hey dude, Smith how are you!
bind: The bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having the reference
of the object passed, now whenever you want to use this returned function in the code you can
use it by passing rest of the arguments.
var inviteEmployee1=invite.bind(emp1);
var inviteEmployee2=invite.bind(emp2);
inviteEmploye1("hi","how are you")
inviteEmploye2("hey","how are you doing?")
Output:
hi John how are you
hey Smith how are you doing
</pre>

<h3>10. What is meant by first class functions</h3>
<pre>
    A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language
are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as
an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a
value to a variable.
1. Example | Assign a function to a variable
const temp = function() {
console.log("Hello World !!");
}
temp();
Output: Hello World !!
We assigned an Anonymous Function in a Variable, then we used that variable to invoke the
function by adding parentheses () at the end.
2. Example | Pass a function as an Argument
function sayHello() {
return "Hello, ";
}
function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
console.log(helloMessage() + name);
}
// Pass “sayHello” function as an argument to “greeting” function
greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
Output: Hello, JavaScript!
3. Example | Return a function
function sayHello() {
return function add() {
console.log("Hello!");
}
}
In this example; We need to return “add” function from another function so add function will
be first class function. We can return a function because we treated function in JavaScript as a
value.

</pre>

<h3>11. What is a spread operator?</h3>
<pre>
    The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to destructure the non-primitive data types like
arrays and objects to access the elements individually.
Code:
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];
console.log(numbersCombined)
Output:
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
</pre>

<h3>12.What are pure functions?</h3>
<pre>
    Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same
arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a program’s
execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.
Let’s see the below JavaScript Function:
function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
return productPrice * 0.05;
}
The above function will always return the same result, if we pass the same productPrice. In
other words, it’s output doesn’t get effected by any other values / state changes. So we can call
“calculateGST” function as a Pure function.
